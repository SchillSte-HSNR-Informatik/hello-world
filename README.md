# hello-world
github tutorial repository - not much to see here

I study Computer Science in Krefeld, Germany, and plan to use github repositories
for both HSNR-related work and private projects. 
Until i find something that bothers me enough to turn it into a project of my own, 
i plan to work on some https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/ challenges.

I like coffee, cats, and also coffee.
